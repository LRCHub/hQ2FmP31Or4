Weightless falls
Honeysuckle
Strangers, strange this
Lights from pages
Paper thin thing
Protected by the naked eye
Pearly sunrise

Nearly worn
Kneeling like a supplicant
Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me
Darkened skin
Afraid to see
Radiate
Open lips
Keep smiling for me

Weightless cool
Honeysuckle
Fair skin freckles
Uncut teeth
Tranquil eyes
Bite my lips
Bite my lips
Shh
Under your feet
