Play this song for its first minute one, then go to the next harlot.
Sherry's young and can't ask why.
So she'll keep looking fine, being lost and catching flies.
Little known her throat has time.
What's it matter, games are forever.

Tries to the singer of the book she writes,
Boredom is a crime.
Now she can't now she can't tell time.

Respects to the burst and the electric wires thirst, over to the sprawl and the talk of to the hand.
Our creams were hit by the squints in chemicals first,
Second a reduce of mysterious land.

Randomness of tendencies Sherry, has typed you gone like text.
My how you miss your attention, the lull spans width of chest.

She's rich here and they're poor there so, when numbers grow and shrink who cares.

Randomness of tendencies Sherry, has typed you gone like text.
My how you miss your attention, the lull spans width of chest.

Yes we eat, yes we shop, yes we sleep and yes, we talk.
All this yes and none this makes restless war on park ground snow.
You yes much want do can anything you.
All the walls are gone, so go kick the rocks.
