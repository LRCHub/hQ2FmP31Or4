I've been too comfortable
Feelin' nothin' at all
Think it's time for a change
I've been afraid of nerves
Figured they'd only hurt
I just need to have faith
Keep me from keepin' me, keepin' me down
Even me, even me out
Free me, so I'm not afraid
Gotta let it go
Let it flutter, let it flutter
Gotta let it go let it flutter
I'm over catchin' butterflies
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh
I'm over catchin' butterflies
So what if I make a fool?
My ego can only bruise
It's nothin' that I can't take
It's better than bein' numb
Waitin' for sleep to come
So I can dream about change
Gotta let it go
Let it flutter, let it flutter
Gotta let it go let it flutter
I'm over catchin' butterflies
I'm over catchin' butterflies
